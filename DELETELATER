Variables that are meaningful to mortality analysis

These are actual urinary metabolite concentrations (exposure biomarkers). They can be linked to mortality indirectly, mainly as markers of caffeine intake and metabolism.

Xanthines (most relevant)

These are the strongest candidates because caffeine exposure has known associations with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

SSMX7 – 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine (caffeine)

SSMX5 – 1,7-dimethylxanthine (paraxanthine, primary caffeine metabolite)

SSMX4 – 1,3-dimethylxanthine (theophylline)

SSMX6 – 3,7-dimethylxanthine (theobromine)

SSMX1 – 1-methylxanthine

SSMX2 – 3-methylxanthine

SSMX3 – 7-methylxanthine

These are typically the core exposure variables used in NHANES caffeine–mortality studies.
